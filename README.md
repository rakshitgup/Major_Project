# Game Design Document (GDD) for **[Game Title]**

## 1. Game Overview
- **Genre**: Horror / Psychological Horror / Adventure
- **Platform**: PC
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine
- **Target Audience**: Fans of atmospheric horror, suspense, and psychological experiences.
- **Game Mode**: Single-player

## 2. Concept
- **Setting**: The entire game takes place inside a single, sprawling indoor environment, such as an abandoned mansion, decaying asylum, or long-forgotten hotel. The setting is designed to immerse the player in a sense of isolation and dread.
- **Core Gameplay**: The player must explore the environment, solve intricate puzzles, and evade a single, unpredictable enemy AI. The focus is on atmospheric tension, puzzle-solving, and psychological horror, rather than combat.

## 3. Story & Narrative
- **Premise**: The protagonist, trapped in a haunting and deteriorating building, must piece together the mystery of what happened to the place and how they got there. The player’s goal is to survive, uncover the truth, and escape before it’s too late. The story unfolds through environmental storytelling, notes, and audio logs.
- **Key Themes**: Fear, isolation, psychological trauma, and survival.
- **Main Characters**: 
  - **The Protagonist**: A person who wakes up inside a dark, decaying building with no memory of how they arrived. As they explore, they uncover clues about their past.
  - **The Antagonist**: A single, terrifying entity that haunts the building, constantly stalking the protagonist, creating a sense of imminent danger. This entity could be a supernatural force or a psychological manifestation, depending on the narrative direction.

## 4. Gameplay Mechanics
- **Movement**: First-person perspective for full immersion. The player can walk, run (with stamina limitations), crouch, and interact with objects in the environment.
- **No Combat**: There is no combat; the player must rely on stealth, evasion, and puzzle-solving to survive. The protagonist cannot fight the enemy but must use environmental tools (e.g., hiding spots, distractions) to avoid being caught.
- **Stealth & Evasion**: The player can hide in closets, under beds, or in shadowed corners to evade the enemy. The environment is key in helping the player stay undetected.
- **Puzzle-Solving**: Complex puzzles must be solved to unlock new areas or pieces of the story. These puzzles will require careful exploration and analysis of the environment.
- **Psychological Horror**: The environment changes dynamically in response to the player’s actions, creating a sense of unease. For example, doors may lock unexpectedly, furniture might move, and lights may flicker. There will be hallucinations and audio-visual disturbances that add to the tension.

## 5. Art Style
- **Visuals**: Realistic yet eerie environments with heavy emphasis on lighting, shadows, and textures. The building should feel decrepit, with aged furniture, broken windows, and dimly lit hallways. Lighting is key to creating suspense, with dim areas and sudden flashes of light to enhance fear.
- **Character Design**: The protagonist should look normal but may gradually show signs of distress through the game, such as dirty clothes, bloodstains, or disheveled hair. The enemy should be terrifying, mysterious, and capable of appearing and disappearing.
- **UI**: Minimalistic HUD with only essential information such as health (if applicable), inventory (for puzzle-related items), and objective hints. The focus is on immersion, so most information should be conveyed through the environment.

## 6. Sound Design
- **Ambience**: The sound design will play a major role in building tension. The environment will be filled with subtle creaks, whispers, distant noises, and echoes that seem to come from nowhere.
- **Sound Effects**: Sudden, sharp noises like doors slamming, footsteps, heavy breathing, or the sound of something moving in the darkness will keep players on edge.
- **Voice Acting**: Occasional voice lines or whispers will give the protagonist’s internal thoughts or hints about the story. The antagonist may not speak, but sounds will be crucial in signaling its presence.
- **Psychological Effects**: Unpredictable sound changes, like the protagonist’s heartbeat accelerating in tense moments, or static noises that suggest something is wrong.

## 7. Enemy AI
- **Types of Enemies**: There is only one enemy AI, but its behavior is unpredictable and terrifying. The AI will stalk the protagonist, reacting to player movement, sound, and interaction with the environment.
- **AI Behavior**: The enemy does not follow a set pattern but is instead driven by a complex set of behaviors. It can hear the player’s footsteps, detect the sound of doors opening, and search rooms if the player is spotted. The enemy will patrol specific areas, but it can also appear unexpectedly, heightening tension.
- **AI Reactions**: The AI may sometimes appear as a shadow or blurred figure, making it difficult for the player to discern if it’s real or a hallucination, adding to the psychological horror.

## 8. Levels & Environment
- **Environment Design**: The entire game is set inside one large, interconnected indoor map. The building’s rooms are designed to be both atmospheric and puzzle-centric. Some rooms may be locked until certain conditions are met or puzzles are solved.
- **Level Progression**: The level will evolve based on player progress. Initially, rooms will appear intact but increasingly deteriorate or change as the player uncovers the building’s past. New areas may open up as puzzles are solved or the storyline progresses.
- **Environmental Changes**: The environment will subtly change in response to the player’s actions. The building might “react” to the protagonist’s fear, such as doors locking automatically or lights flickering as the enemy draws near.

## 9. Technical Features

  - Use of Unreal’s advanced lighting and shadow systems to create atmosphere.
  - Dynamic AI with adaptive behaviors based on player actions.
